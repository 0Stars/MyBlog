        <p>Want something to watch all on one channel?
            That's the videos our channel wants to have.
            You can watch all sorts of videos here, from gaming videos to how to become a creator of tech.
            Information 101 wants to make all kinds of videos, so a lot of the videos come from our other channels and not just this main channel.
            Our channel names information about everything, not how to do this.
            Our only facts are fun facts, and our tutorials are how to code.
            You can support our goal of having one channel with multiple topics by subscribing and sharing our channel with your friends.
